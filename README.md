### Setup
#### `.env` requirements
* `PORT` - Defined by environment

#### Running the app
* run in the app using node

#### Tests
* How do you run tests?
  - run `npm test` in console to see results of tests
* What assertions were made?
  - tested that console logs were being triggered by their corresponding functions
* What assertions need to be / should be made?
  - Not sure I'm clear on what else should be tested, though I'm wondering if we should be testing the read and write file functions?
